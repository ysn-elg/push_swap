# push_swap
A sorting algorithm project using two stacks (`a` and `b`).  
This is the **third project at 1337 (42 Network) school**.

## 🧠 Goal
Sort a list of integers with the fewest possible operations.  
You can only use specific stack operations:
`sa`, `sb`, `ss`, `pa`, `pb`, `ra`, `rb`, `rr`, `rra`, `rrb`, and `rrr`.

The program must output the sequence of operations to sort the numbers.

## ⚙️ Build
```bash
make          # builds push_swap
make clean    # removes object files
make fclean   # removes objects + binary
make re       # rebuilds everything
